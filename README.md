An app that shows recipes based on categories and filters that you define oon the settings screen.
My third app using Flutter, multiple screens with basic navigation, routing and passing arguments,
using Material widgets of Flutter. Non elegant state management methods are used which result in a
small bug and difficulty in future refactoring.
